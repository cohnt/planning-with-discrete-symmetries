# Note: the optimal radii are given in terms of the volume of the collision-free
# configuration space. Since we don't know this value, we instead use the volume
# of the whole configuration space, which leads to a higher radius. This ensures
# asymptotic optimality, but it's potentially not the smallest radius which
# would work.

# Because c_volume is strictly larger than the volume of c_free (unless
# there are zero obstacles), we don't have to add epsilon to handle the
# strictness of the bound.
